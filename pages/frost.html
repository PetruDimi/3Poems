    <h2><strong>The road not taken</strong></h2>
    <p>Robert Frost</p>
    <section>
        <pre>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
        And sorry I could not travel both
        And be one traveler, long I stood
        And looked down one as far as I could
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
            
        Then took the other, as just as fair,
        And having perhaps the better claim,
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
        Though as for that the passing there
        Had worn them really about the same,
            
        And both that morning equally lay
        In leaves no step had trodden black.
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
        I doubted if I should ever come back.
            
        I shall be telling this with a sigh
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
        I took the one less traveled by,
        And that has made all the difference.

        <h4>About the poem</h4>
            <p>   
                "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost is a timeless exploration of choice, individuality, and the paths we take in life. Through the metaphor of a forked road in a yellow wood, Frost contemplates the significance of decisions and the diverging paths we encounter. The poem reflects on the uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in decision-making, as the narrator reflects on choosing one path over another, knowing that it will make all the difference. Frost's evocative language and imagery invite readers to reflect on their own life choices, prompting contemplation on the roads not taken and the impact they might have had. Ultimately, "The Road Not Taken" challenges conventional notions of regret and celebrates the courage to forge one's own path, reminding us that every choice we make shapes our journey and defines who we are.
