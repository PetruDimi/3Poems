    <h2><strong>Autumn</strong></h2>
    <p >Rainer Maria Rilke 1875–1926</p>

        <pre>
    The leaves fall, fall as from far,
    Like distant gardens withered in the heavens;
    They fall with slow and lingering descent.
        
    And in the nights the heavy Earth, too, falls
    From out the stars into the Solitude.
        
    Thus all doth fall. This hand of mine must fall
    And lo! the other one:—it is the law.
    But there is One who holds this falling
    Infinitely softly in His hands.

        <h4>About the poem</h4>
            <p>
            "Autumn" by Rainer Maria Rilke, a renowned German poet, reflects upon the transformative and melancholic essence of the autumn season. In this poem, Rilke intricately weaves imagery of falling leaves, fading light, and the impending arrival of winter to evoke a sense of introspection and existential contemplation. Through vivid descriptions of nature's transition, Rilke captures the bittersweet beauty of autumn, where the vibrant hues of foliage serve as a poignant reminder of life's transient nature. The poem's lyrical verses invite readers to embrace the fleeting moments of the season while contemplating the inevitability of change and the passage of time. With its rich symbolism and evocative imagery, "Autumn" invites readers on a reflective journey into the depths of the human experience amidst the shifting landscapes of nature.
